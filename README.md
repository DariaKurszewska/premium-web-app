**Project Description: Web Application for Access to Premium Content**  

**Project Phase: Early Development & Static Testing**

**My Role:**  
As a **tester and project collaborator** (volunteering), I am involved in the development of a web application that will provide access to premium content for a select group of users. My tasks include assisting in building the application in **WordPress**, organizing tasks in **Jira** and **Confluence**, and supporting project communication.

**Responsibilities:**

1. **Creating application templates and page designs:**
   - I independently create **page drafts** and **templates** for the application in **WordPress**, ensuring they align with business requirements.
   - I collaborate with business stakeholders to finalize templates and integrate key elements such as plugin selection and page structure.
   - Based on the approved templates, I create **Test Cases (TC)** that will be used in further testing once the application enters a more advanced phase.

2. **Early-stage testing:**
   - Currently, I am performing **static testing**, verifying that the prepared page drafts and templates meet business and project requirements.
   - The tests are recorded in **Zephyr**, and testing will take place once the application is moved to the staging environment.

3. **Tools used in the project:**
   - **Jira** and **Confluence** for project management and documentation.
   - **Zephyr** for creating test cases (TC).
   - **WordPress** for content creation and managing the application.
   - **Teams** for communication.

4. **Communication and collaboration:**
   - The project is being carried out in collaboration with the **beneficiary**, who is the developer. Tasks are tracked in **Jira**, and communication primarily happens via **Teams** due to time zone differences.
   - For key project stages and important decisions, we organize **meetings on Teams** to discuss progress and agree on next steps.

5. **Testing process:**
   - At this stage, I perform **static testing** to ensure the page drafts and templates meet the business and project requirements.
   - Once the application is more developed, I will perform **regression testing** and start testing the **API** once the project enters a more advanced phase.

6. **Team collaboration and challenges:**
   - In the project, I work directly with the developer, which involves adjusting to time zone and organizational differences. Due to distance and time zone differences, we decided to manage tasks via **Jira** and keep documentation in **Confluence**, which facilitates information exchange and tracking project progress.
   - Communication within the team takes place mainly via **Teams**, where we leave messages if a topic doesn’t require immediate intervention. In situations that require a faster response or more detailed discussion, we organize **video calls on Teams**. If we are unable to schedule a meeting within 2-3 days, we leave the decision-making details in messages on **Teams** and continue the conversation asynchronously.
   - A challenge is also the fact that the project is in its early stages, so there are numerous changes in requirements, and constant adaptation to the developer's needs is required. At such moments, effective time management, team coordination, and quick decision-making are crucial.

**Additional Notes:**
- The project is at a very early stage, and the application is still in the form of drafts. I hope I will be able to showcase this project once it is finally released.
- I’m excited to be involved in the project at such an early stage, especially in the context of using the **shift-left** approach. This is my first project where I can fully apply this methodology and implement software quality tests from the very beginning, which provides a valuable opportunity for learning and growth in a live project.
